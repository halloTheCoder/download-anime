# download-anime
Downloading anime from 9anime using selenium and python.
Just some code to make watching anime fun by just downloading the specified anime.
Code is wriiten in very unpleasing manner and requires some modification.
Include only **dbs**,**op**,**boruto**.
To include more anime only require to update the dictionary.
Looking forward for more people (especially anime lovers) to contribute to the code and create something awesome.
As it takes a large amount of time to scrapp the info and find the actuall url of the video so any other idea to make the code time efficient is welcomed.
I am thinking of adding a gui to it and would welcome others to help me in it.
